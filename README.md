# B260610-Dissertation
This repository contains the code and environment files used in the dissertation: "Do senescent cells alter kidney structure? An investigation with spatial transcriptomic"
## Repository contents
`Final.ipynb` – End-to-end analysis notebook (data loading → senescence scoring → spatial/neighbourhood analyses → morphology → ligand–receptor).
`environment.yml` – Conda environment with all Python dependencies.
## Quick start
1.Install Conda/Miniconda.                       
2.Create and activate the environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate scanpy                 
```
3.Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
4.Set the data paths in the first code cell (see comments in Final.ipynb), then run the notebook top-to-bottom.

## Data availability
The spatial transcriptomics dataset used in this project was generated by the Ferenbach Lab, IRR, University of Edinburgh, and is described in:
Reck et al., Nature Communications (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59997-4
